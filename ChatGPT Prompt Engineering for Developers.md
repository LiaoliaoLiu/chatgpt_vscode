# Principles of Prompting
- Write clear and specific instructions
- Give the model time to think

## Write clear and specific instructions
### Tactic 1: Use delimiters to clearly indicate distinct parts of the input

### Tactic 2: Ask for a structured output

### Tactic 3: Ask the model to check whether conditions are satisfied
```py
text_2 = f"""
The sun is shining brightly today, and the birds are \
singing. It's a beautiful day to go for a \ 
walk in the park. The flowers are blooming, and the \ 
trees are swaying gently in the breeze. People \ 
are out and about, enjoying the lovely weather. \ 
Some are having picnics, while others are playing \ 
games or simply relaxing on the grass. It's a \ 
perfect day to spend time outdoors and appreciate the \ 
beauty of nature.
"""
prompt = f"""
You will be provided with text delimited by triple quotes. 
If it contains a sequence of instructions, \ 
re-write those instructions in the following format:

Step 1 - ...
Step 2 - …
…
Step N - …

If the text does not contain a sequence of instructions, \ 
then simply write \"No steps provided.\"

\"\"\"{text_2}\"\"\"
"""
response = get_completion(prompt)
print("Completion for Text 2:")
print(response)  # No steps provided
```
### Tactic 4: "Few-shot" prompting (give examples output)
```py
prompt = f"""
Your task is to answer in a consistent style.

<child>: Teach me about patience.

<grandparent>: The river that carves the deepest \ 
valley flows from a modest spring; the \ 
grandest symphony originates from a single note; \ 
the most intricate tapestry begins with a solitary thread.

<child>: Teach me about resilience.
"""
response = get_completion(prompt)
print(response)
```

## Principle 2: Give the model time to “think”
Tactic 1: Specify the steps required to complete a task
Ask for output in a specified format
Tactic 2: Instruct the model to work out its own solution before rushing to a conclusion

# Iterative Prompt Development
The key to be an effective engineer isn't so much about knowing the perfect prompt, it's about having a process to develop prompt that's effective for the application. -- Andrew Ng

# Inferring
## Extract product and company name from customer reviews
```py
prompt = f"""
Identify the following items from the review text: 
- Item purchased by reviewer
- Company that made the item

The review is delimited with triple backticks. \
Format your response as a JSON object with \
"Item" and "Brand" as the keys. 
If the information isn't present, use "unknown" \
as the value.
Make your response as short as possible.
  
Review text: '''{lamp_review}'''
"""
response = get_completion(prompt)
print(response)
```

## Doing multiple tasks at once
```py
prompt = f"""
Identify the following items from the review text: 
- Sentiment (positive or negative)
- Is the reviewer expressing anger? (true or false)
- Item purchased by reviewer
- Company that made the item

The review is delimited with triple backticks. \
Format your response as a JSON object with \
"Sentiment", "Anger", "Item" and "Brand" as the keys.
If the information isn't present, use "unknown" \
as the value.
Make your response as short as possible.
Format the Anger value as a boolean.

Review text: '''{lamp_review}'''
"""
response = get_completion(prompt)
print(response)
